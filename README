To compile the project:
    g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o jeopardy *.cpp
To run:
    ./jeopardy

The program takes in the html source code from a page for a game from 
http://www.j-archive.com/
The program requires all 30 clues to be present in the board for the
Jeopardy! round, which is the first board on the webpage for a given
game. In this folder, I put 4 downloaded webpages:

http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3106
http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=2544
http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=4842
http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3672

which are game1.htm, game2.htm, game3.htm, and game4.htm respectively.

When you run the program, it asks to input the filename of a webpage,
for example: game1.htm

Then the categories and point values are displayed and a list of 
commands to control the game is displayed. The game is played by
choosing clues of a given category and point value and inputting answers.
The correctness of an answer is decided through string comparisons, so
excluding case sensitivity, your answer must be exactly the same to the
stored answer.
